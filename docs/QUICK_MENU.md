# Quick Menu

**Tap the Guide button** (Xbox / PS / Home button) in any app, or on the home
screen, and the Quick Menu slides in over what's playing. The game shows
through behind it and is paused until you close the menu. A remote's **Menu**
key (e.g. programmed on a FLIRC) opens it too.

| Button | Does |
|---|---|
| LB / RB | Switch tabs |
| Up / Down | Choose an entry |
| Left / Right | Adjust a slider, change a device |
| A | Toggle, mute a slider, run an action |
| B, Start, or tap Guide | Close |

**Hold Guide** (1.5 s) to close the current app and go home, or to leave
Discord and go back to your game.

## Tabs

- **Audio**: volume of the current output, which **output** to use (TV
  speakers, soundbar, headset…), which **microphone**, mic level, mute mic.
  Switching output also moves everything already playing to it.
- **Mixer**: a volume slider for each app playing sound, e.g. game,
  Discord voice, music. A mutes that app.
- **Discord**: start Discord in the background, bring it to the front ("Show
  Discord"), and while you're in a call: **mute my mic**, **deafen**, **voice
  volume**. The call controls work at the audio level, so they work with
  Discord hidden.
- **System**: resume, close the current app, sleep, restart, power off.
  Anything that ends what you're doing asks you to press A again.

## Discord with a controller

Discord has no TV interface, so while it's in front your controller works as a
mouse:

| Control | Does |
|---|---|
| Left stick | Move the pointer (push further to go faster) |
| Right stick | Scroll |
| A / X | Left / right click |
| D-pad | Arrow keys |
| Y / B | Enter / Escape |

Join a voice channel, then tap Guide → Discord → *Back to <game>*. The call
keeps going in the background.

## Settings

In `~/.config/hearth/apps.toml` (copy it from `/usr/share/hearth/apps.toml`):

```toml
[quick_menu]
pause_game = false  # keep the game running while the menu is open
```

Steam keeps its own Guide-button menu (Quick Access), so tapping Guide in Steam
opens Steam's menu rather than Hearth's.
