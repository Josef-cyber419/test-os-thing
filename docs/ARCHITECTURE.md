Hearth replaces only the *client command* of Bazzite's Game Mode session.
gamescope, and all of Bazzite's per-device tuning, stays exactly as it was.
Steam becomes a tile: `hearth-steam` runs it with the same flags the stock
session uses (`-gamepadui -steamos3 -steampal -steamdeck`).

`gamescope-session-plus` has a safety net: if its client exits within 60
seconds five times in a row, it resets to the desktop session. So a broken
Hearth update can't leave you with a black screen; you land in Desktop Mode,
where `sudo bootc rollback` is one command away.

## Talking to gamescope

In Game Mode, gamescope runs with `--steam`, and Steam normally does two jobs
Hearth now does itself (read from gamescope's `steamcompmgr.cpp`):

- **Which windows can be shown.** Only windows with a `STEAM_GAME` app ID can
  be focused. The overlay process tags every new window with its app's ID
  (from the window's PID, traced via the X-Resource extension to its systemd
  scope; or its `WM_CLASS`). The home screen tags its own window.
- **Which app is in front.** Setting `GAMESCOPECTRL_BASELAYER_APPID` on the
  root window picks it. Hearth sets it when switching between home, the
  running app and background apps like Discord. It removes it while Steam is
  in front, so Steam can manage focus itself.

The **Quick Menu** is a `STEAM_OVERLAY` window, the same kind as Steam's Quick
Access menu. gamescope draws it above everything; `STEAM_INPUT_FOCUS` gives it
input while open; `_NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY` hides it. It uses a 32-bit (ARGB)
visual and the SDL renderer, so it has real per-pixel transparency and the
game shows through.

## Apps run in systemd scopes

Each app Hearth starts runs in its own systemd user scope
(`hearth-app-<id>_<n>.scope`, or `hearth-bg-…` for background apps). A scope
covers the app and everything it spawns, including Flatpak sandboxes, which
start their own sessions and would escape a process group. That enables:
- **Pause**: the Quick Menu freezes the game's cgroup while it's open
  (`systemctl --user freeze`) and thaws it on close. Turn this off with
  `[quick_menu] pause_game = false` in `apps.toml`.
- **Close**: "Close <game>" and holding Guide stop the whole scope.
- **Window ownership**: `/proc/<pid>/cgroup` names the scope, so the app ID.

State shared between the hub and the overlay lives in
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hearth/state.json` (what's in front, what's running, whether
the menu is open), written under a file lock.

## Components

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `launcher/hearth/hub.py` | Main loop. Loads config, shows the home screen, runs the chosen app in its own scope, starts background apps, keeps the overlay running, shows an error if an app fails to start. |
| `launcher/hearth/overlay.py` | Quick Menu process: Guide gestures, open/close and pause, window tagging, controller-as-mouse for background apps. |
| `launcher/hearth/quickmenu.py` / `quickmenu_view.py` | Quick Menu contents and actions (tested without a display) / its drawing. |
| `launcher/hearth/audio.py` | Output/input devices, volumes and per-app streams via `pactl -f json` (PipeWire). |
| `launcher/hearth/gamescope.py` | X11 properties: `STEAM_GAME` tags, `GAMESCOPECTRL_BASELAYER_APPID` focus, overlay flags. |
| `launcher/hearth/session.py` | Shared state file, systemd scopes (spawn, freeze, thaw, stop), which app owns a PID. |
| `launcher/hearth/pointer.py` | Controller → virtual mouse/keyboard (uinput) for apps without a TV interface. |
| `launcher/hearth/updates.py` | OS version and staged updates (`rpm-ostree status`), running updates through `hearth-update`. |
| `launcher/hearth/ctl.py` | `hearthctl`: status, doctor, logs, update, rollback, enable/disable, dev mode. |
| `launcher/hearth/logs.py` | Log to the journal and `~/.local/state/hearth/hearth.log` (rotated). |
| `usr/libexec/hearth/hearth-update` | Root helper (narrow sudoers rule): run Bazzite's `uupd`, or `bootc rollback`. |
| `launcher/hearth/ui.py` | Rendering (tiles, rows, header, confirm dialog). Sizes derived from screen height. |
| `launcher/hearth/model.py` | Navigation state (rows remember their column). No pygame, easy to test. |
| `launcher/hearth/input.py` | Keyboard / CEC / FLIRC / gamepad → `Nav` actions, stick auto-repeat. |
| `launcher/hearth/homebutton.py` | While an app runs, watches `/dev/input` (read-only) for Guide held 1.5s or `KEY_HOMEPAGE`, then closes the app. |
| `launcher/hearth/config.py` | `apps.toml` parsing and "is this app installed?" checks. |
| `usr/libexec/hearth/hearth-steam` | Runs Steam's console UI inside the current gamescope. |
| `usr/libexec/hearth/shims/steamos-session-select` | On `PATH` for apps started by Hearth. Turns Steam's "Switch to Desktop" into "exit Steam → Hearth home". |
| `usr/libexec/hearth/hearth-desktop` | Real Desktop Mode, via Bazzite's session switcher. |
| `usr/libexec/hearth/hearth-cec` + udev/systemd units | Pulse-Eight USB-CEC: register as a playback device, wake/standby the TV on resume/suspend/shutdown. |
| `usr/libexec/hearth/hearth-esde-update` + user timer | Installs/updates the ES-DE AppImage in `~/Applications` (checksum-verified) and creates `~/ROMs` and `~/BIOS`. |
| `usr/libexec/hearth/hearth-capture` | Full-screen, low-latency mpv view of an Elgato capture card, with its audio looped to the speakers via PipeWire. |
| `usr/libexec/hearth/hearth-flatpak-setup` | First-boot Flathub installs from `flatpaks.list` and `emulators.list`, and gives emulators access to `~/ROMs`, `~/BIOS` and other drives. Each app is attempted until it succeeds once, then never again (so uninstalling sticks). |

### Why Python + SDL2 for the home screen?

SDL2 has the best gamepad support on Linux (the same mappings Steam uses),
draws directly under gamescope with no desktop toolkit, and `python3-pygame`
is packaged in Fedora. The UI is small enough that a game-style immediate-mode
renderer is simpler than a widget toolkit.

### Why a hub loop, not app switching?

gamescope shows one app full-screen at a time, and TV users expect "close app →
home". Running apps one at a time from a loop gives exactly that, frees the GPU
and controllers for the app, and makes failures easy to report (the next home
screen shows what went wrong).

## Testing

- **Unit tests** (`launcher/tests/`): config parsing and layering, navigation,
  input mapping, audio (against recorded `pactl` output), Quick Menu logic,
  session state, updates, `hearthctl`.
- **X11 integration** (`test_x11.py`, needs Xvfb): gamescope window
  properties, and the real overlay opening with true transparency.
- **End to end** (`test_e2e.py`, needs Xvfb): the real hub and overlay with
  fake apps, driven by key presses and `hearthctl`: launch a game, open the
  Quick Menu over it, start Discord in the background, switch back, go home.
  Each step is checked through the properties gamescope reads.
  `HEARTH_E2E_SHOTS=dir` saves composited screenshots.

What these can't cover is gamescope itself, real controllers, PipeWire and
systemd scopes. That's the list below.

## Verify on real hardware

These couldn't be tested without a real machine. Check them first, in this order:

1. **The image builds** against current `bazzite-deck:stable`. `image/build.sh`
   fails loudly if Bazzite's Game Mode session isn't one Hearth overrides.
2. **Hearth and its apps appear in Game Mode.** Hearth tags windows with
   `STEAM_GAME` and picks the front app with `GAMESCOPECTRL_BASELAYER_APPID`,
   as Steam does. (Tested against Xvfb, but not against gamescope itself.)
   Confirm the home screen, Kodi, ES-DE and Discord each come to the front.
3. **Steam from the tile** behaves like normal Game Mode: Quick Access menu,
   performance overlay, sleep, game launching.
4. **Steam → Switch to Desktop** reaches Hearth's shim (i.e. Steam finds
   `steamos-session-select` on `PATH`) and returns home.
5. **Hold Guide** closes VacuumTube/Kodi/ES-DE and returns home. The session user
   needs read access to controller event devices. logind normally grants this
   to the active seat, but confirm it.
6. **CEC**: TV remote keys arrive as arrow/Enter keys. Bazzite also runs
   steamos-manager's CEC service, so check the two don't conflict over `/dev/cec0`.
7. **Remote in each app**: VacuumTube, Jellyfin (`--tv`) and Plex HTPC respond
   to the TV remote's keys (via CEC/FLIRC), not just a controller.
8. **Emulation**: ES-DE starts full screen under gamescope, launches the
   Flatpak emulators, and they can read games from `~/ROMs`, including when it's
   a link to another drive.
9. **HDMI Input**: mpv shows the card at the configured resolution, and the
   audio loopback finds the card's input.
10. **Quick Menu**: tapping Guide shows it over a game, with the game visible
    through it; the game pauses (the user systemd manager can freeze scopes)
    and resumes; audio device switching and per-app volume work through
    `pactl`; closing a game from it returns home.
11. **Discord**: starts in the background, comes to the front from the menu,
    the controller moves a pointer there (needs write access to
    `/dev/uinput`), and mute/deafen affect its call.
12. **Android tile** appears after `ujust setup-waydroid` (it looks for
   `/var/lib/waydroid/waydroid.cfg`) and Bazzite's `waydroid-launcher` displays
   under Hearth's gamescope session.

## Ideas / roadmap

- Real artwork: tile icons from each app's Flatpak metadata or SteamGridDB.
- Settings tile: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth controller pairing, display/audio output, all
  with a controller.
- "Continue playing" row: recent Steam games and recently played emulated games.
- Phone remote: small web page / Home Assistant integration to launch tiles, wake
  the TV, or show what's playing.
- Ambient mode: photo or clock screensaver after idle time on the home screen.
- Profiles: per-person home screens and parental controls.
- Syncthing tile or service for ROM, save and screenshot sync between devices.
